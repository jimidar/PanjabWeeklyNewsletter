	### MOST DANGEROUS ###
	The life of a pirate is not so dangerous

	nor is a bashup in a police lockup

	spying too is not very dangerous

	to be woken up in the middle of the night

	by the secret police

	I admit is nerve wrecking

	so is the quiet lonely fear

	which follows you

	and throttles your chest

	when you are locked up in a cell

	on a framed up false charge

	for a crime you did not commit

	all this I admit is bad enough

	but all these are still not so dangerous

	because the most dangerous thing is

	to live like a dead man

	when you don’t feel any thing

	when the routine of daily life saps you totally

	the fixed life of

	home to work

	work to home

	that is a life without dreams

	that is the most dangerous thing

	that is when

	the hour is alive and kicking for everyone

	excepting for you

	that life is the most dangerous thing

	because

	like the eyes of a dead fish

	you stare at everything

	but cannot feel anything

	about yourself

	or about others

	that’s why

	the most dangerous are those people

	who have forgotten how to love people

	for such people

	live and shift aimlessly

	in the ordinary humdrum orbit of their lives

	in which nothing happens

	nothing moves

	like a placid cemetery

	these people

	are like that cold blooded moon

	which feels nothing

	no pain, love, sympathy or revulsion

	when it goes over the courtyards

	of the innocent victims

	butchered in a slaughter

	the most ugly sight is

	that of a debauched old man

	who is trying to sing a melody

	but only succeeds in racking his weak chest

	So the most dangerous life is the one

	in which our conscience doesn’t prick you

	because your soul is dead

	that’s why I say

	piracy is not so dangerous

	spying is not so dangerous

	bashup in a police lockup is not so dangerous

	the most dangerous life is…
